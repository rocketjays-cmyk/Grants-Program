## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Tagline:
W3b Stitch — a decentralized trust engine for verifying media, credentials, and identities across blockchains.

Brief Description

W3b Stitch provides a platform for creating and verifying proofs of authenticity for digital content and credentials. Through a simple web app, users can anchor proofs on-chain and confirm integrity without relying on centralized authorities. The project bridges decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials, and blockchain anchoring into a unified, user-friendly application.

Integration with Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama

The Polkadot ecosystem is a natural fit for W3b Stitch due to its focus on interoperability and scalability. W3b Stitch can be extended as a Substrate pallet for credential verification, enabling parachains to integrate authenticity checks directly into their logic. Using XCM, proofs of authenticity can move seamlessly between parachains, making W3b Stitch a cross-ecosystem trust layer. Deployment on Kusama would allow for rapid iteration and testing, while Polkadot provides the long-term scalable environment for production use.

Team Interest

Our team is deeply motivated to solve the growing challenge of digital misinformation and unverifiable credentials. We believe that trust is a missing layer in Web3, and Polkadot’s architecture uniquely supports our vision of decentralized, interoperable, and scalable verification. By building W3b Stitch within this ecosystem, we can contribute to the broader mission of creating a trustworthy, open, and user-centric internet.

### Project Details

The initial MVP will feature a web-based dashboard with the following core components:

Upload & Verification Panel – simple drag-and-drop for documents/media with instant verification results.

Credential Viewer – allows users to inspect verifiable credentials (VCs) and DID metadata.

Proof History – displays anchored transactions and status checks.
(Mockups available upon request; early wireframes demonstrate minimal but intuitive interactions for verification and credential anchoring.)

Data Models / API Specifications

Data Model:

Credential object (issuer, subject, metadata, proof hash).

ProofRecord object (hash, timestamp, anchor transaction ID, verification status).

Core APIs:

POST /anchor → submit hash for anchoring.

GET /verify/{hash} → confirm existence and validity on-chain.

GET /credential/{id} → retrieve credential metadata and verification record.

PoC / MVP or Prior Work

Core repo includes hash anchoring on EVM testnets (Sepolia) to validate workflow.

Whitepaper and provisional patent filed, outlining system architecture and long-term trust engine roadmap.

What the Project Will Not Provide

W3b Stitch is not a storage platform for raw media files; it anchors proofs, not content itself.

It will not replace existing identity providers; rather, it complements them via interoperability with DID/VC standards.

It will not deliver a public blockchain from scratch; instead, it leverages Substrate and Polkadot’s ecosystem.

It is not intended as a moderation tool for social platforms but as a verification layer they can integrate.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

W3b Stitch fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a decentralized trust layer. By providing verifiable proofs for media, credentials, and identity, it can integrate with parachains, wallets, and dapps that need authenticated data flows. Using Substrate, a verification pallet can be implemented to make trust primitives available across parachains, and XCM can ensure that proofs are portable and interoperable. In this way, Polkadot serves as the base layer for trust, and W3b Stitch extends that value across the ecosystem.

Who is your target audience?

Developers building parachains, dapps, and wallets who need verifiable credentialing and media authenticity services.

Enterprises seeking Web3-based solutions for credential authentication, compliance, and fraud prevention.

End users who want confidence that the content they consume or credentials they rely on are authentic.

The wider Polkadot ecosystem, where trust and verification primitives can be reused by multiple teams.

What need(s) does your project meet?

W3b Stitch addresses the urgent need for everyday digital trust in Web3. It creates the infrastructure for verifying the authenticity of media, credentials, and identities in a scalable and decentralized way. With misinformation, fraud, and unverifiable credentials becoming systemic issues, W3b Stitch provides a standards-based solution built on DIDs, VCs, and blockchain anchoring.

How did you identify these needs?

The project began as an on-chain news aggregator and evolved as research and experimentation revealed broader applications. The architecture was expanded to cover media authenticity, identity, credentials, and security — ultimately forming the W3b Stitch trust engine. A provisional patent filed with the USPTO secures the novel architecture. Market research and analysis of digital trust trends confirmed the gravity and scale of the problem: misinformation and identity fraud already cost billions annually, and existing centralized solutions fail to meet Web3’s interoperability and transparency needs.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

No. After extensive research, there appear to be no projects in the ecosystem that combine the robust flows and modular architecture of W3b Stitch. While some projects address decentralized identity or verifiable credentials in isolation, none integrate media verification, credential authentication, and decentralized identity into a cohesive trust layer.

If not, why might such a project not have been possible or attempted before?

Until recently, Web3 infrastructure was focused primarily on DeFi and token economies. The combination of standards (DIDs, VCs), maturing Substrate tooling, and Polkadot’s cross-chain messaging now makes it possible to deliver a scalable, multi-domain trust engine. Earlier attempts outside Polkadot likely failed due to siloed design, lack of interoperability, and limited adoption of trust standards.

Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?

No direct equivalents exist. While certain ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) have experiments in identity or credentialing, none provide the modular, multi-domain trust architecture proposed by W3b Stitch. This novelty, combined with Polkadot’s interoperability and governance model, makes the project uniquely positioned to succeed here.
